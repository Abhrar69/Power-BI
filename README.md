With sales dataset containing data on clothing and accessories. 

1. Constructed a matrix to display the percentage 
contribution of each category to the total sales. This will provide insights into 
each category's relative performance within overall sales. (total sales = 
SUM(sale_amount)). The total_sales column values shouldnâ€™t change when a 
filter like category or brand is applied
2.  Created a card visual to showcase sales by category. 
and respond only to category-specific filters applied to the sales 
table, ensured it remains unaffected by other types of filters
